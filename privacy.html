                                            We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that all Influencers on the Website: (i) are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) verify their identity. Before you can start a Influencer account, we will:
                                            Ask you to provide Influencer User Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data).
                                            Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
                                            Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data). This is necessary so that payments can be made to Influencers for content, and so that Influencers can access their earnings via the Website. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
                                            Ask you to go through a third-party age and identity verification process:
                                            This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
                                            As described at Section 9 (categories of personal data), we do not collect, receive, possess, or have access to any Face Recognition Data collected or processed by our third-party providers through this process.
                                            Where permitted by applicable law, we receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
                                            Check that you have not previously been banned from using the Website and our Services (e.g. as a result of violating our Terms of Service ).
                                            Followers
                                            We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that: (i) all Followers on the Website are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) Followers in certain locations verify their identity. Before you can start a Follower account, we will:
                                            Ask you to provide Follower User Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data).
                                            Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
                                            Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data). This is necessary so that Followers can make payments to Influencers. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
                                            Ask you to go through a third-party process to gain assurances of your age. The specific process will depend upon your location and the third-party provider. This may include:
                                            Third-party age and identity verification
                                            For certain locations, we are required to verify the age and identity of our Followers, so we need to take additional steps. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
                                            As set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), we do not ourselves collect, receive, possess, or have access to this data.
                                            Where permitted by applicable law, we may receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
                                            Third-party age estimation
                                            For certain locations, we use third-party providers to conduct age estimation. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif "selfie" (that you provide to the third-party provider) and using digital technology to estimate your age, which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data.
                                            If you go through the third-party age estimation process, we will only receive the results of the process (pass / fail and reason for failing), to maintain a record of the age estimation process.
                                            If you fail the third-party age estimation process (e.g. if you are over 18 years of age, but their technology has predicted that you look under 18 years of age), you may have the option to go through the third-party age and identity verification process set out above.
                                            MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ONBOARDING PROCESSES
                                            Why does Talk2Me use third-party face recognition technology?
                                            The use of face recognition technology by our third-party providers is an important technological measure used in our wider onboarding processes for Influencers and Followers. It is intended to ensure safety on the Website and our compliance with applicable laws.
                                            We use third-party service providers to carry out age and identity verification, who carry out these services on our behalf, as data processors.
                                            How does Face Recognition Data help to prevent fraud?
                                            Face recognition technology reduces the possibility of fraudulent face image spoofing and the uploading of fraudulent government identity documents when individuals go through the onboarding process.
                                            Where our third-party providers have identified possible fraud attempts (such as the use of fake or otherwise manipulated documents) our third-party providers may maintain a record of such attempts, including Face Recognition Data, for the purposes of detecting unlawful activity and preventing access to the Website.
                                            Periodic authentication of your identity
                                            During the time that you hold an account with us, we may require you to periodically authenticate your identity. If you have gone through the third-party age identity verification process, where permitted by applicable law our third-party providers may retain Face Recognition Data to enable you to authenticate your identity. Where this is retained, you do not need to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again when authenticating your identity.
                                            Withdrawing your consent: You may withdraw your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data for the purposes of subsequent authentication (and delete this) by contacting corporate.talk2me@gmail.com . While withdrawing your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data will not affect your ability to complete a subsequent authentication process, it may require you to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again during the authentication process.
