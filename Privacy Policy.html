                      <h2 class="h5">Our onboarding processes</h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">Influencers
                          We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that all Influencers on the Website: (i) are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) verify their identity. Before you can start a Influencer account, we will:
                          Ask you to provide Influencer User Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data).
                          Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
                          Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data). This is necessary so that payments can be made to Influencers for content, and so that Influencers can access their earnings via the Website. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
                          Ask you to go through a third-party age and identity verification process:
                          This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
                          As described at Section 9 (categories of personal data), we do not collect, receive, possess, or have access to any Face Recognition Data collected or processed by our third-party providers through this process.
                          Where permitted by applicable law, we receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
                          Check that you have not previously been banned from using the Website and our Services (e.g. as a result of violating our Terms of Service ).
                          Followers
                          We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that: (i) all Followers on the Website are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) Followers in certain locations verify their identity. Before you can start a Follower account, we will:
                          Ask you to provide Follower User Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data).
                          Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
                          Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data). This is necessary so that Followers can make payments to Influencers. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
                          Ask you to go through a third-party process to gain assurances of your age. The specific process will depend upon your location and the third-party provider. This may include:
                          Third-party age and identity verification
                          For certain locations, we are required to verify the age and identity of our Followers, so we need to take additional steps. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
                          As set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), we do not ourselves collect, receive, possess, or have access to this data.
                          Where permitted by applicable law, we may receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data), to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
                          Third-party age estimation
                          For certain locations, we use third-party providers to conduct age estimation. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif "selfie" (that you provide to the third-party provider) and using digital technology to estimate your age, which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data.
                          If you go through the third-party age estimation process, we will only receive the results of the process (pass / fail and reason for failing), to maintain a record of the age estimation process.
                          If you fail the third-party age estimation process (e.g. if you are over 18 years of age, but their technology has predicted that you look under 18 years of age), you may have the option to go through the third-party age and identity verification process set out above.
                          MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ONBOARDING PROCESSES
                          Why does Talk2Me use third-party face recognition technology?
                          The use of face recognition technology by our third-party providers is an important technological measure used in our wider onboarding processes for Influencers and Followers. It is intended to ensure safety on the Website and our compliance with applicable laws.
                          We use third-party service providers to carry out age and identity verification, who carry out these services on our behalf, as data processors.
                          How does Face Recognition Data help to prevent fraud?
                          Face recognition technology reduces the possibility of fraudulent face image spoofing and the uploading of fraudulent government identity documents when individuals go through the onboarding process.
                          Where our third-party providers have identified possible fraud attempts (such as the use of fake or otherwise manipulated documents) our third-party providers may maintain a record of such attempts, including Face Recognition Data, for the purposes of detecting unlawful activity and preventing access to the Website.
                          Periodic authentication of your identity
                          During the time that you hold an account with us, we may require you to periodically authenticate your identity. If you have gone through the third-party age identity verification process, where permitted by applicable law our third-party providers may retain Face Recognition Data to enable you to authenticate your identity. Where this is retained, you do not need to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again when authenticating your identity.
                          Withdrawing your consent: You may withdraw your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data for the purposes of subsequent authentication (and delete this) by contacting corporate.talk2me@gmail.com . While withdrawing your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data will not affect your ability to complete a subsequent authentication process, it may require you to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again during the authentication process.

                          Task carried out in the public interest: We may process personal data as necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. This may include, for example, reporting illegal activity to relevant law enforcement authorities, other governmental agencies and non- governmental organisations.
                          We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
                          </p>
                      <h2 class="h5">Obtaining your personal data</h2>

                          Our third-party service providers: Such as our IT, payment processing, customer support, content and text moderation, and age and identity verification / age estimation service providers. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of services to support business functionality).
                          Our professional advisers: Such as our legal advisors, bankers, auditors, accountants, consultants, and insurers. Our professional advisors will process personal data as necessary to provide their services to us. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of professional services).
                          Corporate: Relevant third parties in the event of a possible sale, merger, acquisition, business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our and the relevant third parties' legitimate interests (namely assessing and putting into effect potential transactions).
                          Our group companies: For the centralised coordination and management of our business, in accordance with the purposes set out at Section 9 (categories of personal data).

These recipients will use your personal data in the performance of their regulatory, law enforcement or otherwise charitable or not-for-profit role. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that the processing is either necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or necessary for our, or a third-party's, legitimate interests, or where it is in the interests of the wider public to do so (namely reporting illegal content to, and assisting with requests from, such authorities, regulators and organisations, to protect the safety of our users and third parties).

                      </h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">You have certain rights regarding the collection and processing of personal data. You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details set out at Section 19 (assistance and contact information).
                          Under certain circumstances and subject to certain exemptions, you have the right to:

                          Withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data: Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

                          Request to know or access to your personal data: You may receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

                          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you: You may correct any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you.

                          Request deletion / erasure of your personal data: You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to process it. You also may ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). Please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request of deletion / erasure for specific legal reasons.

                          Request the restriction of processing of your personal data: You may ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

                          Request the transfer of some sections of your personal data to another party.

                          You also have the right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest for the processing and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.

                          We do not process personal data that is subject to solely automated decision-making, where that decision-making is likely to have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.

                          You also have the right:

                          To lodge a complaint with a data protection regulator. For example, in the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and in Switzerland, this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). If you are resident in the EEA, you may wish to contact your local country or state-specific data protection regulator.

                          Depending on your location, to not receive retaliatory or discriminatory treatment in connection with a request to exercise the above rights, or appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. All appeal requests should be submitted by contacting us using the contact details set out at Section 19 (assistance and contact information).</p>

                          If you submit the request yourself, please ensure that your request contains sufficient information to allow us to confirm your identity and properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                          In order to verify your identity, we may at times need to request additional personal data from you, taking into consideration our relationship with you and the sensitivity of your request. In certain circumstances, we may decline a privacy rights request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity.
                          If your request is made by a third-party authorised by you, we will also require proof that the third-party has permission to submit the request on your behalf (such as a signed document evidencing that the third-party has authority to make the request).

                          for the purposes of identifying and reporting illegal activity, protecting the safety of our users and third parties, or otherwise protecting the rights and property of our users, us, and other third parties (e.g. where you have, or we have reason to believe that you have, violated our Terms of Service, and in circumstances where users are banned from further access to the Website);
